            I am Senior Software Engineer based in New Zealand. I tend to start many passion projects after plenty of research.
            A lot of my	projects tend to focus on learning the underlying technology used rather than production ready project.

            I mainly focus on writing backend systems and occasionaly touch
            some front-end (this website being one of the front-ends ðŸ˜…).
